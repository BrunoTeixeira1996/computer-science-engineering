# Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations and Initial Value Problems

Implement the following numerical methods in MatLab:

- Euler (beta version with memory "allocation")
- Euler modified
- Runge-Kutta of order 2 (RK2)
- Runge-Kutta of order 4 (RK4)
- Function that uses MatLab's ODE45
- Another method of choice

The report (called Relat√≥rio) shows the formulas for each method and explains (in portuguese) the implementation.
