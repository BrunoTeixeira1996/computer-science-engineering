# Numerical Methods for Systems of Differential Equations

Implement the following methods so they work in systems of differential equations with initial conditions:

- Euler
- Euler modified
- Runge-Kutta of order 2 (RK2)
- Runge-Kutta of order 4 (RK4)

If possible, get the exact solution for the problem.

The report (called Relat√≥rio) shows the formulas for each method and explains (in portuguese) the implementation.
