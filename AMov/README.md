# Arquiteturas MÃ³veis

Also known as Mobile Architectures.

In my year Flutter was introduced to the course's program and the android development was switched from Java to Kotlin.

There were two group assignments. I did mine with with [@litsame](https://github.com/litsame) and [@pedromnh](https://github.com/pedromnh). The first assignment can be found in the respective folder and the second assignment can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/litsame/amov-flutter).
