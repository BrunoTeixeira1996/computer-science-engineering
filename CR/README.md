# Conhecimento e Raciocínio

Also known as Knowledge and Reasoning.

This course is done almost entirely in MatLab. As of writting this, ISEC offers a student license for the software (Arménio's fight finally paid off, congrats to him), so be sure to make use of it.

There was only one group assignment. I did mine with [@JOSEALM3IDA](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA). You'll be able to find it in [this repository](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA/isec-trabalho-cr).
