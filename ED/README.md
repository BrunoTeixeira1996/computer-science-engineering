# Estruturas de Dados

Also know as Data Structures.

The purpose of this course is to teach data structures (obviously) and what would be the best use case depending for each type.

Besides that, it also teaches how to make more general code, by using iterators and generics (in Java).

For the IDE I'd recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). The Community version will suffice but, if you're interested, JetBrains offers a [student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

The presentation (radix-trie.pptx) was done for a seminar where other students taught other student some data structures we weren't able to learn during the classes. It was a group assigment. I did it with [@pedromnh](https://github.com/pedromnh).
