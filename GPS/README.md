# Gest√£o de Projeto de Software

Also known as Software Project Management.

There was only one group assignment (in which you spend the entire semester). I did mine with [@litsame](https://github.com/litsame), [@AlvarSML](https://github.com/AlvarSML), [@brktnmn](https://github.com/brktnmn) and [@pedromnh](https://github.com/pedromnh). You'll be able to find it in the respective folder.
