# Introdução à Programação

Also known as Introduction to Programming.

Even tho I used Visual Studio for this course, for the love of God don't do the same!

My recommendation is that you start compiling code through the shell. If you're a Windows user get [MingW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

For the IDE I'd recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (also, I recommend turning on the option to have "Open with Code" in the Window's context menu).

To compile code, simple use this command:

`gcc <file_name.c> -o <executable_name.exe>`
