# Modelação e Design

Also known as Modeling and Design.

In this course you'll use a software called StarUML which is payed and doesn't offer a student license. Luckily, there's a really easy way of unlocking it! To do so, you simply need to decompile it, change the function that checks the licence to always return true and recompile. This way, you can export images for the reports without the ugly background saying '**UNLICENSED**'.

There was only one group assignment. I did mine with [@JOSEALM3IDA](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA). You'll be able to find it in [this repository](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA/isec-material/tree/main/MD-2021/trabalho).
