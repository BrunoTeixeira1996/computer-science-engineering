# Simulation of a Virus' Spread

Very basic program, written in C, to simulate the spread of a virus (supposedly COVID-19).

To compile, simply run the following command:

`gcc environments.c main.c peoples.c simulation.c utils.c -o out`

To generate environments for the program I made a smaller program that can be found inside the folder **EnvironmentGenerator**.

The report (called Relat√≥rio) explains (in portuguese) the implementation and the data structures used. It also contains a small user manual.
