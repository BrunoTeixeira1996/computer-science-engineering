# Programação Avançada

Also known as Advanced Programming.

For the IDE I'd recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). The Community version will suffice but, if you're interested, JetBrains offers a [student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

To make the state machine diagrams I used yUML with the help of [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JaimeOlivares.yuml) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
