# Connect Four

Simple implementation of connect four in Java, using JavaFX to write a GUI for the game.

If you recognise the sounds in the game it's because they were taken from [Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us).

The report (called Relat√≥rio) explains (in portuguese) the implementation and the data structures used. It also contains a small user manual.
