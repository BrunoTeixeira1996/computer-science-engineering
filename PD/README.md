# Programação Distribuída

Also known as Distributed Programming.

For the IDE I'd recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). The Community version will suffice but, if you're interested, JetBrains offers a [student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

There was only one group assignment (divided intro three parts). I did mine with [@danielmribeiro](https://github.com/danielmribeiro) and [@franciscooferreiraa](https://github.com/franciscooferreiraa). You can find it in the respective folder.

Final Grade: 16 out of 20
