# Programação Orientada a Objetos

Also known as Object Oriented Programming.

My recommendation is that you start compiling code through the shell. If you're a Windows user get [MingW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

For the IDE I'd recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (also, I recommend turning on the option to have "Open with Code" in the Window's context menu).

To compile code, simple use this command:

`g++ <file_name.cpp> -o <executable_name.exe>`

There was only one group assignment. I did mine with [@JOSEALM3IDA](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA). You'll be able to find it in [this repository](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA/Material-ISEC/tree/main/POO-2020/Trabalho).
