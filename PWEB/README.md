# Programação WEB

Also known as WEB Programming.

You'll feel forced to use Visual Studio. If you do so, make yourself a favor and install [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (don't forget JetBrains offers a [student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)).

There was only one group assignment. I did mine with [@BrunoTeixeira1996](https://github.com/BrunoTeixeira1996). You'll be able to find it in [this repository](https://github.com/BrunoTeixeira1996/Apontamentos-ISEC/tree/master/3%C2%BAAno/PWEB/TP).
